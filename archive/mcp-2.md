Okay, I'll revise the previous response to more explicitly highlight and integrate the Docker-related aspects of the project. I'll focus on clarifying the Docker setup, usage, and its role in both development and production environments.

**Initial Assessment (Revised) {{assessment}} {{overview}} {{docker}}**

The project is designed for containerization using Docker, which is a key feature for consistent deployments and simplified development setup. The `config/dockerfile` and `config/docker-compose.yaml` files define the Docker image and multi-container setup, respectively. The previous response touched on Docker, but this revision will make it a central focus. The presence of both Node.js and Python servers is still a point of interest, and we'll address how Docker handles this.

**Contextual Insights (Revised) {{context}} {{docker}}**

*   **`dockerfile`:** This file specifies how to build the Docker image for the `claude-mcp-server`. It starts from a Node.js base image, installs dependencies (both Node.js and Python), and sets up the environment. The `CMD` instruction indicates that the Node.js `simple-server.js` is the default entry point when the container starts.
*   **`docker-compose.yaml`:** This file defines a multi-container application.  It currently defines a single service (`claude-mcp-server`) that builds from the `dockerfile`. It also sets up port mapping (exposing port 3000) and mounts several local directories (`src`, `data`, `config`) as volumes. This volume mounting is crucial for development, as it allows changes to the local code to be reflected immediately inside the container without rebuilding the image (hot-reloading).
*   **Development vs. Production:** The Docker setup can be used for both development and production.  The volume mounting is primarily for development convenience.  For production, you would typically build the image and run it without mounting volumes, ensuring a self-contained and immutable deployment.
*   **Python Server in Docker:** The `dockerfile` includes the installation of Python dependencies (`config/requirements.txt`). This means the Python server *can* be run inside the container, even though the default entry point is the Node.js server. We'll provide instructions for running the Python server within the Docker context.

**Component Breakdown (Revised) {{components}} {{docker}}**

The Docker-related components are:

1.  **`config/dockerfile`:**  Defines the image build process.
2.  **`config/docker-compose.yaml`:** Defines the multi-container application (currently just the single `claude-mcp-server` service).
3.  **`.dockerignore` (implied):**  Although not explicitly provided, a `.dockerignore` file is good practice to exclude unnecessary files (like `node_modules`, `.git`, etc.) from the Docker image, making builds faster and images smaller. We'll suggest creating one.

**Reasoning and Analysis (Revised) {{reasoning}} {{docker}}**

The Docker setup is well-structured for development. The key improvements we'll make are:

1.  **Explicit Docker Instructions:**  Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for building and running the container in both development and production modes.
2.  **Python Server in Docker:**  Explain how to run the Python server inside the running container.
3.  **`.dockerignore`:**  Recommend creating a `.dockerignore` file.
4.  **Clarify Volume Mounting:**  Emphasize the role of volume mounting for hot-reloading during development.

**Output Generation Guidance (Revised) {{guidance}} {{docker}}**

We'll update the `README.md` with a dedicated section on Docker, and we'll provide a sample `.dockerignore` file. The `package.json` scripts are already set up for Docker, so no changes are needed there.

**Examples (Revised) {{examples}} {{docker}}**

````

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd claude-mcp-server
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `claude-mcp-server` directory (and optionally in `config/`) by copying the `.env.example` file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Then, fill in your API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google:

    ```
    # .env
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=3000
    DEFAULT_AI_PROVIDER=anthropic  # or openai, google
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
    ```

3.  **Node.js Server (Recommended):**

    *   **Install Dependencies:**

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

    *   **Run in Development Mode:**

        ```bash
        npm run dev  # Uses simple-server.js
        # OR
        npm run dev:custom # Uses custom-server.js
        ```
        The `--watch` flag automatically restarts the server on code changes.

    *   **Run in Production Mode:**

        ```bash
        npm start # Uses simple-server.js
        ```

    *   **Run Tests:**

        ```bash
        npm test
        npm run test:watch  # Watch mode
        npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
        ```

    *   **Linting and Formatting:**

        ```bash
        npm run lint
        npm run lint:fix  # Automatically fix linting errors
        npm run format
        npm run format:check
        ```

4.  **Python Server (FastAPI):**
    * **Install Dependencies (from claude-mcp-server directory):**
        ```bash
        pip install -r config/requirements.txt
        ```
    *   **Run the Server:**
        ```bash
        npm run start:python
        ```
    *   **Note:** The Python server might be less actively maintained than the Node.js server.

## Docker Usage

Docker is the recommended way to run the `claude-mcp-server`, especially for production deployments. It provides a consistent and isolated environment.

1.  **Create a `.dockerignore` file (Recommended):**

    Create a file named `.dockerignore` in the `claude-mcp-server` directory with the following content:

    ```
    node_modules
    .git
    .DS_Store
    npm-debug.log
    Dockerfile
    docker-compose.yaml
    .env
    tests/
    ```
    This prevents unnecessary files from being included in the Docker image.

2.  **Build the Docker Image:**

    ```bash
    npm run docker:build
    # or, equivalently:
    # docker-compose build
    ```

3.  **Run the Container (Development Mode - with Hot Reloading):**

    ```bash
    npm run docker:run:dev
    # or, equivalently:
    # docker-compose -f config/docker-compose.yaml up --build
    ```

    This command uses the `config/docker-compose.yaml` file to:

    *   Build the image (if it hasn't been built already or if changes are detected).
    *   Start a container named `claude-mcp-server`.
    *   Map port 3000 on your host machine to port 3000 inside the container.
    *   Mount the `src`, `data`, and `config` directories as volumes.  This means that any changes you make to these directories on your host machine will be immediately reflected inside the running container, allowing for hot-reloading during development.

4.  **Run the Container (Production Mode):**

    ```bash
    npm run docker:run
    # or, equivalently:
    # docker-compose up
    ```

    This command starts the container *without* mounting the local directories as volumes. This is suitable for production because the container will use the code and configuration that were baked into the image during the build process.

5.  **Running the Python Server Inside the Docker Container:**

    Even though the Node.js server is the default entry point, you can still run the Python server within the running Docker container:

    *   **Get a Shell Inside the Container:**

        ```bash
        docker exec -it claude-mcp-server /bin/bash
        ```
        This command opens an interactive bash shell inside the running `claude-mcp-server` container.

    *   **Run the Python Server:**

        ```bash
        python src/api/server.py
        ```
        You can now access the Python server on port 8000 *inside* the container.  To access it from your host machine, you would need to either:
            *   Modify `docker-compose.yaml` to also expose port 8000.
            *   Use `curl` or a similar tool *from within the container* to interact with the Python server on `localhost:8000`.

6. **Stopping the Container:**
    ```bash
     docker-compose down
    ```

## Usage

Once the server is running (either Node.js or Python), you can interact with it via MCP-compliant clients. The server exposes tools that can be invoked using a JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol.  The specific tool names and parameters are defined within the `src/tools` directory (for the Node.js server) and `src/core/mcp_tools.py` (for the Python server). Refer to `howTO.md` for available tools.

**Meta-Reflection (Revised) {{meta-reflection}} {{docker}}**

This revision significantly improves the clarity and completeness of the Docker instructions.  It emphasizes the distinction between development and production modes, explains how to run the Python server within the container, and recommends creating a `.dockerignore` file. The use of `docker-compose` is also made more explicit. The next steps, beyond those mentioned in the previous response, would be:

1.  **Multi-Container Setup:** If the Python and Node.js servers are intended to run concurrently, consider defining them as separate services in `docker-compose.yaml`. This would allow them to communicate with each other within the Docker network.
2.  **Health Checks:** Add health checks to the `dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` to ensure the servers are running correctly.
3.  **Production Deployment:** Provide guidance on deploying the Docker image to a container registry (like Docker Hub or a private registry) and running it on a production server (e.g., using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes).

**Logging and Versioning (Revised) {{logging}}**

```
Version: v1.2 | Timestamp: 2024-02-05T20:15:00Z | Summary: Revised README to include detailed Docker instructions, including development and production modes, running the Python server inside the container, and creating a .dockerignore file.
```

This revised response provides a comprehensive and clear guide to using Docker with the `claude-mcp-server` project, addressing the user's request and adhering to the System Prompt's principles.
