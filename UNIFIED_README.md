# Unified MCP Servers Project

## Project Overview
This project integrates the functionalities of Claude MCP Server and Cursor MCP Server into a single unified server using Docker. The unified server provides AI tools (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic), static and dynamic code analysis, and other extensible features across applications.

## Timeline and Milestones

### Project Start
- **October 12, 2023**: Project initiation with the goal to unify Claude MCP and Cursor MCP servers.
  - Objectives outlined: Unify AI providers, integrate code analysis, validate Docker configurations.

### Phase 1: Exploration and Planning
- **October 13-14, 2023**:
  - Reviewed directories and documentation of Claude MCP and Cursor MCP.
  - Documented the integration plan in `UNIFIED_DOCKER_PLAN.md`.
  - Identified overlaps:
    - Claude MCP: `tools/ai`, `tools/code`
    - Cursor MCP: `packages/code-analysis`, `packages/ml-services`

### Phase 2: Implementing Unified AI Provider
- **October 15-16, 2023**:
  - Implemented `UnifiedAIProvider` class in `src/unifiedAIProvider.js`:
    - Merged AI provider logic for OpenAI and Anthropic.
    - Added core methods like `generateResponse`, `analyzeCode`, `suggestImprovements`, and `enhanceDocumentation`.
  - Successfully tested provider logic in Docker environment.

### Phase 3: Code Analysis Integration
- **October 17, 2023**:
  - Integrated Cursor MCPâ€™s `code-analysis` package with `SonarQubeAnalyzer` for static analysis.
  - Unified `analyzeCode` method to combine static analysis and AI insights.
  - Converted `sonarqube.ts` to CommonJS-compatible `sonarqube.js` for Node.js compatibility.

### Phase 4: Docker Configuration and Validation
- **October 18, 2023**:
  - Planned consolidation of `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` configurations from both MCP servers into a single orchestrated setup.

## Current Status
- Unified server successfully integrates:
  - AI provider management (Claude MCP logic).
  - Static and dynamic code analysis (Cursor MCP analyzers + Claude analysis tools).
- Next step: Finalize Docker configurations and validate deployment.
