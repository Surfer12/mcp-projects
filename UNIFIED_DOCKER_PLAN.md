# Unified Docker Server Integration

## Overview
This project aims to unify the functionality of the `claude-mcp-server` and `cursor-mcp-server` into a single, Docker-based server for seamless integration across applications.

## Plan
1. **Directory Analysis:**
   - Compare `src` (Claude MCP) and `packages` (Cursor MCP) to identify overlaps and integration points.
   - Assess tool implementation and modularity.

2. **Docker Configuration:**
   - Combine Docker setups from both projects.
   - Review and unify Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` configurations.

3. **Testing:**
   - Incorporate testing scripts and tools.
   - Validate functionality in unified architecture.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update READMEs for both projects.
   - Consolidate into a single README for the unified structure.

## Current Status
### Claude MCP Server:
- **Path:** `/Users/ryanoates/mcp-projects/claude-mcp-server`
- **Key Components:**
  - `src/`: Source code.
  - `test/`: Test scripts.
  - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

### Cursor MCP Server:
- **Path:** `/Users/ryanoates/mcp-projects/cursor-mcp-server`
- **Key Components:**
  - `packages/`: Classified code modules.
  - `docker/`: Docker configuration.
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Container orchestration.

## Next Steps
- Analyze `src/` and `packages/` for duplication and complementary tools.
- Review Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml` in both projects.
